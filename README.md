Writing something about myself: I maintain websites trying not to have to code.  I generally let editing programs and widgets do the coding so I can focus on content and design.  But the HTML I learned has been SO useful.  And I have learned a little CSS but run into my limits.  So now here I am trying to learn whatever additional code will help me maintain web sites, find problems in underlying code, and develop social media.
